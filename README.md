## Description: <br>
The processes of incremental hierarchical translation of end-user languages, high-level languages, and languages of virtual machines into the target language of a given computer system are studied. The techniques and principles of language translation processes in modern pervasive, ubiquitous, and invisible distributed systems are described. A brief survey and history of programming languages and language translators are given. Language translation is explained through basic processes of source program analysis and target program synthesis. Major phases of analysis (lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis) and synthesis (intermediate code generation, optimization, and target code generation) are included. Run-time and load-time support for program execution are presented. Language translator generators are studied.
